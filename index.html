            <p>Don’t sell anxiety every day, how many billion people would have been killed if you could become a programmer?</p>
<p>Aren’t programmers good?  Excellent!  Do you have to be more anxious than those who are lucky, born well, catch up with the bonus period, and are more desperate than you?<br>Programmers must be a small circle.  Programmers are still far from surplus, but the threshold is getting higher and higher. You lament that saturation is just how easy it is to earn money if you don’t work hard.<br>There are a large number of people studying the program, but not many can really stick to it.<br>Of course, you see many people asking questions on a whim, but few of them really stick to it.<br>I came out of a training class, and I was the only one who insisted on the development in the end.  There is still a threshold.<br>If you include all the lovers, there will be 10 million in China, but there are very few that can really be developed.  Programmers are the highest paid jobs for pure work, the top of the pyramid.<br>Making money in our country is nothing more than ability and resources.  Programmers are rare jobs where you can earn a high salary by your ability.  If you want to earn money, it has something to do with it, or you have resources, or you are in the wind, or you can catch up with the bonus, or you can enjoy the spring breeze.  It is obviously much more difficult to earn programmer’s salary purely by ability than programmer’s industry in other industries.  However, there is a threshold for programmers, and I personally witnessed a lot of people who want to learn programs and finally can’t stick to it.<br>Programmer industry is saturated, in fact, all industries are saturated, don’t you lose money in opening milk tea shops?  Can you make money as an anchor?  Don’t you have to worry about eating and drinking and not earn money?  Do you still have that fool to cheat?  Work?  Dry sales?  Copywriting?  Doing finance?<br>Now this question: () Is the industry saturated?  Fill in the brackets casually, the answer is saturated.<br>The time for learning something simple has long passed.<br>The Internet era has developed for a long time. With the passage of time, the Internet industry has become more and more professional, and the requirements for post personnel have become higher and higher.<br>In the first few years of the Internet, as long as you know some skills, you will have jobs with a monthly salary of over 10,000 yuan. However, up to now, programmers with monthly salary of over 10,000 yuan have very high requirements for skills reserve and project experience.</p>
<p>Many people want to be programmers for high salaries, but everyone’s logic is different. The logic of a person determines how far he can go.  (The results can be determined according to laws)</p>
<ol>
<li>Some people like to encounter difficulties. Every time they encounter difficulties and solve them, they will make some progress.</li>
<li>Some people are afraid of difficulties and feel that difficulties are their limit. They are naturally unable to do it and are not suitable for it. Then they flinch and give up. If they do not change their logic, even if they do not give up for the time being, they will not develop far in the field of programmers.<br>Think about one thing that the boss arranges in the work and the behavior of different people: the first person will do everything possible to solve the problem. he can ask his predecessors, search online and other solutions. he will not give up and eventually find a solution to finish the job successfully.</li>
</ol>
<p>-when the problem is solved, the boss will be happy, reuse, promotion and salary increase.<br>As a programmer, I have also made progress, and my ability has also improved, and I have gradually developed further.  The second person will think about what to do if he encounters problems. Maybe he knows to ask his predecessors and search the Internet. If he cannot find them, he will abandon himself and feel that he is incapable of solving them by nature.<br>-or directly not to find a solution, only to find their own reasons can not be solved.<br>-The problem cannot be solved, the work cannot be finished, the boss is unhappy, despises and despises, and it is good not to be dismissed.<br>-As a programmer, he did not finish his work and was looked down upon coldly by his boss. He had no hope of growth, promotion and salary increase. Because of his way of doing things, he caused a series of negative butterfly effects on himself. Finally, he could not stand the negative and depressing environment and left.<br>-that is, not suitable for programmers.  The second person this kind of situation, is also very common in people who want to change programmers, in order to pay and change, meet difficulties and flee.<br>There will be no surplus of Chinese programmers, either they will be eliminated after a few years of work due to lack of progress, or their skills will gradually become stronger and they will go to higher positions.</p>

            <p>I am going to send this answer three times and return it to the draft box three times, because I expect it will lead to war … I don’t want to touch on this topic which will lead to war if I am not careful.  But I brushed up a few answers that made me very uncomfortable.  But let’s answer the question first:<br>At present, the general environment is seriously affected and all walks of life are basically having a hard time.<br>It is inevitable that programmers will face greater competitive pressure. Not only programmers are inevitable, but all professions will or have already experienced this process.  Why?  If a profession is in a state of short supply for a long time and the society does not increase the output of talents in this profession … it can only be a social problem.<br>Therefore, from the perspective of social development.  Programmers will definitely have a relative surplus as the supply of talents increases.  This is the fate that no profession can escape.  There is no such thing as a son of heaven in this world.<br>As long as the development of social productive forces cannot catch up with the supply of talents, relative surplus is inevitable.  But this year and in the years to come this situation … productivity is not bad until it is retired.</p>
<p>The division of labor in modern society means that any occupation is essential in the short term.  Therefore, don’t belittle other industries by such small-child bickering tactics as how important our industry is.  There is no other meaning except to annoy people.<br>To tell the truth, there are some answers that use “programmer a bug will destroy billions”, “trading system has a bug direct loss xx” to indirectly raise their own can be saved.<br>Because there are things that can cause big problems in any industry.  For example, I can give you a row of examples:</p>
<p>One node of the assembly line made a mistake and the whole line was shut down. Maybe it would have to be reworked.  How much is the loss?<br>Do you know how much the loss is when the fab trips?<br>Do you know what will happen if the drawings are written incorrectly?<br>Do you know the worst consequences of the border fire among the soldiers?<br>What is the worst consequence of a wrong sample?<br>What is the consequence of the teller’s sister’s wrong number?<br>What is the possible consequence if the cable is not sealed carefully when building the sea-crossing bridge?<br>What’s more, they said that “we are different from ordinary workers on the assembly line”, “several meters of e-books can’t be chewed down” to ridicule the real industry, and they also made the so-called “no black programmers” and “labor is equal and it is not easy for everyone to mix.”<br>Eldest brother, it has been 20 years since the 21st century. Programmers cannot be the only ones who have evolved.  Is it true that auto production line is a decoration?  You don’t really think that the standardized things are all artificial assembly lines, do you?<br>No, no, no, no, no.<br>At a time when this aunt Suguan is painstakingly studying how to efficiently catch out the litter that is not classified and thrown away … she even thinks that other industries can still chew the old books without making progress?<br>Just because you know how to program, you can’t think that all the programming in the world is like this.  Before and after the end of the winner-take-all great god, write a numerical control machine tool control code estimates will certainly be spray dead:</p>
<p>Who told you to use a mending knife?<br>Who made it cut backwards?<br>Do you know it is easy to break a knife?<br>Do you know how to reduce the tool life?<br>Do you know you can stick a knife?<br>Do you know that the tolerance has changed?<br>It’s really not a good idea to forcibly extend the programmer’s set of standards to other fields and create a chain of disdain.</p>

            <p>There are many such problems.<br>Let me sum it up myself.<br>1, there is no surplus, but it is not so rare.  In other words, the Internet is maturing.  The demand is more mature and stable.<br>20,000 Essential Oils Answer: High-end will always be scarce, while low-end will always be redundant.<br>And then.<br>The Internet industry is not always good.  The development of China’s Internet is closely related to infrastructure, policies, keeping up with the times, etc.  Taobao, QQ, which are now giants, did not sit on the bus at the beginning, and it was also very difficult to survive.  It’s not too much to go through many wars, so look at the Internet and don’t compare it with big factories.  Keep your eyes down.<br>I am a web worker, so let’s talk about it.<br>Many years ago, there was no front-end position, but the web became more and more abundant, and this position was gradually separated. at that time, our technology was still three swordsmen, flash, etc.  At that time, some of these skills will help you find a job.  When Lei Jun was a student, he sold money when he made things himself.  But now, it’s not that easy, gadgets, source code, flying everywhere.  If it is really lacking, it will be outsourced.<br>The Internet is slowly developing.  Infrastructure has also come up.  The business is getting more and more complicated.  The front-end development, now you can only three swordsmen, but it is difficult to find a job.  (Apart from being proficient in js and the like).<br>At the front end, the web is also developing, making web pages, and code technology is also developing. making web pages seems less difficult. now buying code, please outsource, can help us to make a project soon, and the cost of building a website is getting lower and lower.<br>Internet projects are becoming more and more mature and abundant.  The problems faced by former grassroots stationmaster and now grassroots stationmaster are also different.  In fact, he is also a grass-roots stationmaster, making it more and more difficult to make money.  Traffic is getting more and more expensive.  It’s getting harder and harder.<br>What I said may not be relevant to answering the Lord’s questions, but I already answered the Lord’s questions at the beginning.  The surplus has not yet arrived.  Secondly, there is no shortage of people.  Of course, if you are just looking for a job, you can also look at the recruitment, which is still a lot of demand.<br>Then, quoting Wan essential oil, he replied: In fact, when any industry develops to a certain level, it is scarce at the high end and redundant at the low end.<br>The reason why I want to say the following is because I want to express my opinion.  Because I see a lot of people still indulge in “I’m good at technology, I’m fine, the Internet is still booming” and so on. I feel humble as I am, and I still want to sing the opposite tune.<br>As I said above.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Internet has developed to a certain stage. Now it is no longer the time when you can use technology or have ideas to fight alone.<br>2, code, or the cost of doing the project, is not so high, so difficult.  You can directly buy a lot of source code, or invite people to do projects, grassroots webmasters or something, which is not so well developed.</li>
<li>The flow inlet is getting smaller and smaller.  The cost of obtaining customers is getting higher and higher.</li>
<li>I know this sentence is very harsh, but the reality is: everything except innovation and marketing is cost.  Including programmers.  Therefore, programmers are the part of cost that does not make money.<br>Of course, some people will say, no programmers, which products, which people write code?  If you stick to this idea, then you must be prepared, that is, to keep healthy and to keep yourself always the middle or above class of 100 programmers.  Personally, I think it should be one of 25.  Would it be safer (100 people are just examples).<br>Above.  The answer is over.<br>Programmers are not as exaggerated as the surplus, and there are still many jobs to be filled.<br>Wan essential oil replied: high-end is short, low-end is much.<br>Don’t be too optimistic, don’t be told that this line is not working, just jump up and down, or think of yourself as different from other industries.<br>Also don’t always hold the “technology-centered theory”, think more about things other than technology, etc.<br>What is the difference between yourself and the programmers of the past?<br>What is the difference between yourself and the programmer who was laid off?  Are they really not strong enough?<br>Can you really keep growing?<br>Can you make money if you do it by yourself?  What else is missing in the project profit besides this project?  Promotion?  Operation?<br>The company went bankrupt because of its superb technology.  Do I have a way out?  What can I do without this platform?<br>At the end of 18 years, it was too profound for me. I didn’t think of the difficult words in the future.  Not good.</li>

            <p>Two of my programmer colleagues.<br>The first one, I looked at her code and felt as dizzy as two kilos of carbon monoxide.  I took the sisters to the office and asked her.<br>“Do you know the difference between a class and a thread?”<br>I’m not talking about classes and inheritance, I’m talking about classes and threads.  Because I think she calls a thread by calling a class.<br>The sister faltered and could not answer.<br>How did you graduate?  As a result, the girl cried with a loud voice.<br>My heart was flustered, and I immediately condemned myself.  And he was given 2 weeks to write a script with the function of the number of zeros appearing in the string.<br>This kind of simple demand, you don’t see children programming teaching, generally can’t see.<br>This sister is really not at all polite. It really took two weeks to finish.  I have a look, 1 hour processing 3000 lines of text.  We have 5 million lines of text that he can process until the end of next year.<br>That’s great. I can’t write a script with such moving speed.<br>I finished the same function in 2 hours.  Combined with working 8 hours a day, I calculated that our work efficiency was 40 times worse.<br>Another sister, the engineering level is outrageous.<br>Tab, the space bar mix, resulting in all kinds of invisible errors also calculate.<br>One day, he wrote a divine code-<br>arr = arr.append(1)<br>Well, we use python<br>Can make this kind of problem, from birth to now, the code amount does not exceed 100 lines.<br>The girl’s battle for fame was one day when her model could run on her own computer. Here, the same data and the same model could run with different results.<br>Another mistake I can’t write seriously.  Subtle programmers are the same, interesting programmers write bugs that change endlessly!<br>I looked at his source code and found that the code she loaded the model was in tryexception.<br>However, if the load fails, it will not report any errors and pass directly.  Our versions are different, so every time the model is defined and not loaded, it is judged.<br>Don’t question the authenticity, because this kind of mistake, can’t write three body imagination, is not made up.<br>Programmers are not in excess at all, especially in these new fields, ai and Internet of Things.  It is a real blue sea!<br>What does the blue sea mean?  It’s all water!</p>
<p>Some questions about the comment area:<br>What’s the problem?<br>List.append () is an address operation that can directly add a variable to the end of the list without returning.  And its return value is Null.<br>Append is one of the most commonly used operations in arrays, so few lines of code have been written to write this bug.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>New people should embrace this view.  If you think that I did this wrong, the following contents are meaningless to you.  If you think there is something wrong with this view after seeing it, but do not know where the specific problem is, I will tell you the problem of this view.<br>If one point of view can easily explain everything, but only can’t solve the problem.  Then this view is useless.  New people should embrace the idea that it is useless.  If you move your mouth and skin, you can stand on the moral high ground and judge the behavior of others.  After judging, there was no way to solve any problems.<br>So what is the more correct view?  It depends on the degree.  We will tolerate and help others’ problems.  If and only if the problem is not low-level.  If the mistakes made by this person are too low-level and are common in children’s programming courses, then this person is not worth sticking to.</li>

            <p>Excess, please leave some living space for programmers now</p>
<p>I think it’s not easy for programmers, so let’s go and develop other industries.<br>It is very good to set up stalls. I feel that it is unlikely to be surplus in a short period of time as long as it is not banned.<br>In this way, it can not only ensure the sustained and healthy development of the computer industry, but also ensure that they stand in front of the new air outlet.<br>In this way, there will be no internal volume and no surplus.</p>
<p>The code is not so easy to write, you need to read a lot of documents before writing the code.<br>In the words of the predecessors, after reading so many documents, you may end up writing a few lines of code.<br>I don’t know whether the functions implemented are useful to users yet.<br>Just so - called</p>
<p>A look at the document is as fierce as a tiger and a write code is as unintelligent as a dog.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the field of programmers, Impostor Syndrome is more serious psychologically.</p>
<p>In fact, everyone is doing the work of screwing screws. From interns to tech lead, it is said that they all feel similar.</p>
<p>It is really important to maintain a healthy state of mind.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there will be no tragedies for programmers</p>
<p>In the field of programmers, it is important to learn all one’s life as the technology is updated so quickly, but it is also important to know one’s strengths and give full play to them.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, it is not easy for programmers to enter the industry. What is taught and trained cannot be quickly translated into engineering.</p>
<p>In particular, large companies, technology debt I do not know if you have any feelings</p>
<p>If you want to get started in a big company, you can’t write a toy project without knowing where you are.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of lines of code, clue can’t touch, it is normal</p>

            <p>Seeing that programmers have little chance of interviewing without three years of experience?</p>
<p>What skills do you have that require more skill than the real job?</p>
<p>Even programmers who have been working for some years are embarrassed to be unable to answer questions in interviews?</p>
<p>More and more training institutions of all kinds?<br>Programmers at work need to study various new technologies or algorithms that are not commonly used at work after work, so that the underlying principles can remain competitive?</p>
<p>The recruitment was released and dozens or hundreds of resumes were received.</p>
<p>Does the above situation mean that the programmer is saturated and surplus?<br>If there is a surplus, what is the ratio of supply to demand?</p>
<p>Here is an answer:</p>
<p>Excess.<br>It is very simple to see whether an industry is surplus or not. You just need to see if your competitors are similar to you.</p>
<p>But whenever you find a large number of your competitors:</p>
<p>I am older than you, have higher education background, better technology, more experience, and require the same salary as you.</p>
<p>That is iron surplus.</p>
<p>Don’t listen to those who say that there is no surplus at the high end and surplus at the low end. Of course, the high end is scarce everywhere.</p>
<p>But as a human being, don’t think you are superior to others.</p>

            <p>Programmers are essentially different from workers in textile factories, shoe factories and steel factories who burn boilers.<br>Attention is paid to the essential difference in working methods, not to say that there are differences in class status as workers. In class status, there is no essential difference in the type of work as a programmer between workers in textile factories, shoe factories and steel factories who burn boilers.<br>The biggest difference between programmers and other types of labor is that programmers’ labor cannot be simply duplicated, while the labor of textile factory workers and shoe factory workers is basically simply duplicated, producing the same products day after day with the same technology and little difference in appearance.<br>Programmers are closer to jobs that cannot be simply copied by early blacksmiths, modern doctors, lawyers, etc., but programmers work directly in the abstract layer instead of the physical layer and do not need physical copying.<br>Ford invented assembly line production, which breaks down the process of manufacturing a car and trains workers into simple and duplicated labor force specialized in manually completing the process, thus improving labor productivity.  However, in the software development industry, enterprises that want to refer to Ford’s assembly line approach have all failed, and none of them have succeeded, because computers can complete tasks that can be simply copied without manual copying.  Even in modern automobile manufacturing, simple processes are completed by robots, and workers are no longer required to repeat simple labor manually.<br>Programmers are one step closer than craftsmen, doctors and lawyers. Therefore, I said that the type of work of programmers has undergone qualitative changes and is essentially different from other types of work.  This qualitative change is that programmers will eliminate the work of programmers who once existed.  For example, early programmers did not have a good debugger, and it was very important for them to understand stacks. Then programmers built advanced debuggers for themselves. Now programmers do not need to understand stacks of binary data at all.  This kind of phenomenon has also happened to artisans, but artisans still need to repeatedly create their own tools to facilitate their own, but programmers do not need to. After a tool is invented, it can be shared by all programmers without the traditional “duplication” of labor costs. The speed of self-innovation is unprecedented in any traditional labor.<br>This rapid self-innovation has led programmers to be more like researchers and engineers than workers who provide simple repetitive work. Any simple skills already mastered quickly become outdated, and any project is like a brand-new research.  This qualitative change will have a great impact on the composition of the labor force, and more and more labor will work at the abstract level instead of making physical copies through simple labor-assisted machines.<br>This qualitative change will also lead to a change in the class status of the working class. In the past, the ruling class could control the operation of the society by controlling all kinds of physical resources through ownership. However, if the whole society works at the abstract level, the concept of ownership of the ruling class will fall apart. When ordinary physical objects are no longer important, more important ideas, algorithms and ideas are difficult to label as ownership and can be quickly shared.  The meaning of the traditional ruling class will be shaken.<br>In the future, everyone may be “programmers”, but probably not all of them need to write code.</p>

            <p>I feel that we are also very low-key, and do not flaunt that we have to be superior. They are all working. There are still some differences between ordinary workshop workers and us. The on-line and off-line skills of workshop workers and their responsibilities are sometimes not at the same level as programmers.<br>Some programmers lost billions of dollars due to downtime, investors lost hundreds of millions due to bugs in financial products, companies lost due to incorrect calculations in financial and reporting systems, and bugs due to transfer systems. These are all programmers’ pots. The exchange rate is not right. bug can also lead to economic losses in settlement. The above are all kinds of scenarios that programmers who maintain the system in your mouth can’t do well.<br>If you look at Ali’s disaster preparedness, can you endure that the money in your Alipay is somehow stolen? Can you tolerate your system being hacked to steal all your business information? Can you stand being sold all kinds of personal information and harassed by phone calls every day? Which of the above is not the pot of data leakage or the pot of product bug?<br>To put it bluntly, who do you want to manage this billion-dollar business without offering people a good price? Capital is for profit, not for fools. Investors must always be treated as fools. If nothing happens, we will blow a wave of wind and belittle our programmers. How can we programmers have the spare time to hack other professions? We haven’t worked honestly yet? How many gb and dozens of gb of source code do you see in your company?<br>If you look at a few mb of e-books, it’s too much content. You’re still hacking at our programmers. With such a complicated business, tens of megabytes of code are embedded in each other’s logic. Sometimes you make a mistake, and you’re likely to have a big disaster in your life, you know?<br>Textile workers are no different from us in terms of labor. We are all workers, all in the service industry, all working for capital. But can they bear the same responsibilities behind them? Can mistakes cost the same? Can you bear the same result?<br>Please don’t be a black programmer. Who doesn’t mix? Is it not good to let each other go? What is tuyere pig? Do you think fortune 996 is joking with you? Laughing all day and earning money? How come there are so many programmers who died suddenly without so much pressure? You’ve been a fool working overtime, you know? Now some people say that you are a pig of tuyere, aren’t you angry?<br>One day our programmers will collectively lose their jobs and will no longer be pigs in that wind tunnel. You can just look at the 1990s and still want to surf the Internet. Learn typing? Slash eggs at home, you!</p>

            <p>Don’t sell anxiety every day, how many billion people would have been killed if you could become a programmer?</p>
<p>Aren’t programmers good?  Excellent!  Do you have to be more anxious than those who are lucky, born well, catch up with the bonus period, and are more desperate than you?<br>Programmers must be a small circle.  Programmers are still far from surplus, but the threshold is getting higher and higher. You lament that saturation is just how easy it is to earn money if you don’t work hard.<br>There are a large number of people studying the program, but not many can really stick to it.<br>Of course, you see many people asking questions on a whim, but few of them really stick to it.<br>I came out of a training class, and I was the only one who insisted on the development in the end.  There is still a threshold.<br>If you include all the lovers, there will be 10 million in China, but there are very few that can really be developed.  Programmers are the highest paid jobs for pure work, the top of the pyramid.<br>Making money in our country is nothing more than ability and resources.  Programmers are rare jobs where you can earn a high salary by your ability.  If you want to earn money, it has something to do with it, or you have resources, or you are in the wind, or you can catch up with the bonus, or you can enjoy the spring breeze.  It is obviously much more difficult to earn programmer’s salary purely by ability than programmer’s industry in other industries.  However, there is a threshold for programmers, and I personally witnessed a lot of people who want to learn programs and finally can’t stick to it.<br>Programmer industry is saturated, in fact, all industries are saturated, don’t you lose money in opening milk tea shops?  Can you make money as an anchor?  Don’t you have to worry about eating and drinking and not earn money?  Do you still have that fool to cheat?  Work?  Dry sales?  Copywriting?  Doing finance?<br>Now this question: () Is the industry saturated?  Fill in the brackets casually, the answer is saturated.<br>The time for learning something simple has long passed.<br>The Internet era has developed for a long time. With the passage of time, the Internet industry has become more and more professional, and the requirements for post personnel have become higher and higher.<br>In the first few years of the Internet, as long as you know some skills, you will have jobs with a monthly salary of over 10,000 yuan. However, up to now, programmers with monthly salary of over 10,000 yuan have very high requirements for skills reserve and project experience.</p>
<p>Many people want to be programmers for high salaries, but everyone’s logic is different. The logic of a person determines how far he can go.  (The results can be determined according to laws)</p>
<ol>
<li>Some people like to encounter difficulties. Every time they encounter difficulties and solve them, they will make some progress.</li>
<li>Some people are afraid of difficulties and feel that difficulties are their limit. They are naturally unable to do it and are not suitable for it. Then they flinch and give up. If they do not change their logic, even if they do not give up for the time being, they will not develop far in the field of programmers.<br>Think about one thing that the boss arranges in the work and the behavior of different people: the first person will do everything possible to solve the problem. he can ask his predecessors, search online and other solutions. he will not give up and eventually find a solution to finish the job successfully.</li>
</ol>
<p>-when the problem is solved, the boss will be happy, reuse, promotion and salary increase.<br>As a programmer, I have also made progress, and my ability has also improved, and I have gradually developed further.  The second person will think about what to do if he encounters problems. Maybe he knows to ask his predecessors and search the Internet. If he cannot find them, he will abandon himself and feel that he is incapable of solving them by nature.<br>-or directly not to find a solution, only to find their own reasons can not be solved.<br>-The problem cannot be solved, the work cannot be finished, the boss is unhappy, despises and despises, and it is good not to be dismissed.<br>-As a programmer, he did not finish his work and was looked down upon coldly by his boss. He had no hope of growth, promotion and salary increase. Because of his way of doing things, he caused a series of negative butterfly effects on himself. Finally, he could not stand the negative and depressing environment and left.<br>-that is, not suitable for programmers.  The second person this kind of situation, is also very common in people who want to change programmers, in order to pay and change, meet difficulties and flee.<br>There will be no surplus of Chinese programmers, either they will be eliminated after a few years of work due to lack of progress, or their skills will gradually become stronger and they will go to higher positions.</p>

            <p>I am going to send this answer three times and return it to the draft box three times, because I expect it will lead to war … I don’t want to touch on this topic which will lead to war if I am not careful.  But I brushed up a few answers that made me very uncomfortable.  But let’s answer the question first:<br>At present, the general environment is seriously affected and all walks of life are basically having a hard time.<br>It is inevitable that programmers will face greater competitive pressure. Not only programmers are inevitable, but all professions will or have already experienced this process.  Why?  If a profession is in a state of short supply for a long time and the society does not increase the output of talents in this profession … it can only be a social problem.<br>Therefore, from the perspective of social development.  Programmers will definitely have a relative surplus as the supply of talents increases.  This is the fate that no profession can escape.  There is no such thing as a son of heaven in this world.<br>As long as the development of social productive forces cannot catch up with the supply of talents, relative surplus is inevitable.  But this year and in the years to come this situation … productivity is not bad until it is retired.</p>
<p>The division of labor in modern society means that any occupation is essential in the short term.  Therefore, don’t belittle other industries by such small-child bickering tactics as how important our industry is.  There is no other meaning except to annoy people.<br>To tell the truth, there are some answers that use “programmer a bug will destroy billions”, “trading system has a bug direct loss xx” to indirectly raise their own can be saved.<br>Because there are things that can cause big problems in any industry.  For example, I can give you a row of examples:</p>
<p>One node of the assembly line made a mistake and the whole line was shut down. Maybe it would have to be reworked.  How much is the loss?<br>Do you know how much the loss is when the fab trips?<br>Do you know what will happen if the drawings are written incorrectly?<br>Do you know the worst consequences of the border fire among the soldiers?<br>What is the worst consequence of a wrong sample?<br>What is the consequence of the teller’s sister’s wrong number?<br>What is the possible consequence if the cable is not sealed carefully when building the sea-crossing bridge?<br>What’s more, they said that “we are different from ordinary workers on the assembly line”, “several meters of e-books can’t be chewed down” to ridicule the real industry, and they also made the so-called “no black programmers” and “labor is equal and it is not easy for everyone to mix.”<br>Eldest brother, it has been 20 years since the 21st century. Programmers cannot be the only ones who have evolved.  Is it true that auto production line is a decoration?  You don’t really think that the standardized things are all artificial assembly lines, do you?<br>No, no, no, no, no.<br>At a time when this aunt Suguan is painstakingly studying how to efficiently catch out the litter that is not classified and thrown away … she even thinks that other industries can still chew the old books without making progress?<br>Just because you know how to program, you can’t think that all the programming in the world is like this.  Before and after the end of the winner-take-all great god, write a numerical control machine tool control code estimates will certainly be spray dead:</p>
<p>Who told you to use a mending knife?<br>Who made it cut backwards?<br>Do you know it is easy to break a knife?<br>Do you know how to reduce the tool life?<br>Do you know you can stick a knife?<br>Do you know that the tolerance has changed?<br>It’s really not a good idea to forcibly extend the programmer’s set of standards to other fields and create a chain of disdain.</p>

            <p>There are many such problems.<br>Let me sum it up myself.<br>1, there is no surplus, but it is not so rare.  In other words, the Internet is maturing.  The demand is more mature and stable.<br>20,000 Essential Oils Answer: High-end will always be scarce, while low-end will always be redundant.<br>And then.<br>The Internet industry is not always good.  The development of China’s Internet is closely related to infrastructure, policies, keeping up with the times, etc.  Taobao, QQ, which are now giants, did not sit on the bus at the beginning, and it was also very difficult to survive.  It’s not too much to go through many wars, so look at the Internet and don’t compare it with big factories.  Keep your eyes down.<br>I am a web worker, so let’s talk about it.<br>Many years ago, there was no front-end position, but the web became more and more abundant, and this position was gradually separated. at that time, our technology was still three swordsmen, flash, etc.  At that time, some of these skills will help you find a job.  When Lei Jun was a student, he sold money when he made things himself.  But now, it’s not that easy, gadgets, source code, flying everywhere.  If it is really lacking, it will be outsourced.<br>The Internet is slowly developing.  Infrastructure has also come up.  The business is getting more and more complicated.  The front-end development, now you can only three swordsmen, but it is difficult to find a job.  (Apart from being proficient in js and the like).<br>At the front end, the web is also developing, making web pages, and code technology is also developing. making web pages seems less difficult. now buying code, please outsource, can help us to make a project soon, and the cost of building a website is getting lower and lower.<br>Internet projects are becoming more and more mature and abundant.  The problems faced by former grassroots stationmaster and now grassroots stationmaster are also different.  In fact, he is also a grass-roots stationmaster, making it more and more difficult to make money.  Traffic is getting more and more expensive.  It’s getting harder and harder.<br>What I said may not be relevant to answering the Lord’s questions, but I already answered the Lord’s questions at the beginning.  The surplus has not yet arrived.  Secondly, there is no shortage of people.  Of course, if you are just looking for a job, you can also look at the recruitment, which is still a lot of demand.<br>Then, quoting Wan essential oil, he replied: In fact, when any industry develops to a certain level, it is scarce at the high end and redundant at the low end.<br>The reason why I want to say the following is because I want to express my opinion.  Because I see a lot of people still indulge in “I’m good at technology, I’m fine, the Internet is still booming” and so on. I feel humble as I am, and I still want to sing the opposite tune.<br>As I said above.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Internet has developed to a certain stage. Now it is no longer the time when you can use technology or have ideas to fight alone.<br>2, code, or the cost of doing the project, is not so high, so difficult.  You can directly buy a lot of source code, or invite people to do projects, grassroots webmasters or something, which is not so well developed.</li>
<li>The flow inlet is getting smaller and smaller.  The cost of obtaining customers is getting higher and higher.</li>
<li>I know this sentence is very harsh, but the reality is: everything except innovation and marketing is cost.  Including programmers.  Therefore, programmers are the part of cost that does not make money.<br>Of course, some people will say, no programmers, which products, which people write code?  If you stick to this idea, then you must be prepared, that is, to keep healthy and to keep yourself always the middle or above class of 100 programmers.  Personally, I think it should be one of 25.  Would it be safer (100 people are just examples).<br>Above.  The answer is over.<br>Programmers are not as exaggerated as the surplus, and there are still many jobs to be filled.<br>Wan essential oil replied: high-end is short, low-end is much.<br>Don’t be too optimistic, don’t be told that this line is not working, just jump up and down, or think of yourself as different from other industries.<br>Also don’t always hold the “technology-centered theory”, think more about things other than technology, etc.<br>What is the difference between yourself and the programmers of the past?<br>What is the difference between yourself and the programmer who was laid off?  Are they really not strong enough?<br>Can you really keep growing?<br>Can you make money if you do it by yourself?  What else is missing in the project profit besides this project?  Promotion?  Operation?<br>The company went bankrupt because of its superb technology.  Do I have a way out?  What can I do without this platform?<br>At the end of 18 years, it was too profound for me. I didn’t think of the difficult words in the future.  Not good.</li>

            <p>Two of my programmer colleagues.<br>The first one, I looked at her code and felt as dizzy as two kilos of carbon monoxide.  I took the sisters to the office and asked her.<br>“Do you know the difference between a class and a thread?”<br>I’m not talking about classes and inheritance, I’m talking about classes and threads.  Because I think she calls a thread by calling a class.<br>The sister faltered and could not answer.<br>How did you graduate?  As a result, the girl cried with a loud voice.<br>My heart was flustered, and I immediately condemned myself.  And he was given 2 weeks to write a script with the function of the number of zeros appearing in the string.<br>This kind of simple demand, you don’t see children programming teaching, generally can’t see.<br>This sister is really not at all polite. It really took two weeks to finish.  I have a look, 1 hour processing 3000 lines of text.  We have 5 million lines of text that he can process until the end of next year.<br>That’s great. I can’t write a script with such moving speed.<br>I finished the same function in 2 hours.  Combined with working 8 hours a day, I calculated that our work efficiency was 40 times worse.<br>Another sister, the engineering level is outrageous.<br>Tab, the space bar mix, resulting in all kinds of invisible errors also calculate.<br>One day, he wrote a divine code-<br>arr = arr.append(1)<br>Well, we use python<br>Can make this kind of problem, from birth to now, the code amount does not exceed 100 lines.<br>The girl’s battle for fame was one day when her model could run on her own computer. Here, the same data and the same model could run with different results.<br>Another mistake I can’t write seriously.  Subtle programmers are the same, interesting programmers write bugs that change endlessly!<br>I looked at his source code and found that the code she loaded the model was in tryexception.<br>However, if the load fails, it will not report any errors and pass directly.  Our versions are different, so every time the model is defined and not loaded, it is judged.<br>Don’t question the authenticity, because this kind of mistake, can’t write three body imagination, is not made up.<br>Programmers are not in excess at all, especially in these new fields, ai and Internet of Things.  It is a real blue sea!<br>What does the blue sea mean?  It’s all water!</p>
<p>Some questions about the comment area:<br>What’s the problem?<br>List.append () is an address operation that can directly add a variable to the end of the list without returning.  And its return value is Null.<br>Append is one of the most commonly used operations in arrays, so few lines of code have been written to write this bug.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>New people should embrace this view.  If you think that I did this wrong, the following contents are meaningless to you.  If you think there is something wrong with this view after seeing it, but do not know where the specific problem is, I will tell you the problem of this view.<br>If one point of view can easily explain everything, but only can’t solve the problem.  Then this view is useless.  New people should embrace the idea that it is useless.  If you move your mouth and skin, you can stand on the moral high ground and judge the behavior of others.  After judging, there was no way to solve any problems.<br>So what is the more correct view?  It depends on the degree.  We will tolerate and help others’ problems.  If and only if the problem is not low-level.  If the mistakes made by this person are too low-level and are common in children’s programming courses, then this person is not worth sticking to.</li>

            <p>Excess, please leave some living space for programmers now</p>
<p>I think it’s not easy for programmers, so let’s go and develop other industries.<br>It is very good to set up stalls. I feel that it is unlikely to be surplus in a short period of time as long as it is not banned.<br>In this way, it can not only ensure the sustained and healthy development of the computer industry, but also ensure that they stand in front of the new air outlet.<br>In this way, there will be no internal volume and no surplus.</p>
<p>The code is not so easy to write, you need to read a lot of documents before writing the code.<br>In the words of the predecessors, after reading so many documents, you may end up writing a few lines of code.<br>I don’t know whether the functions implemented are useful to users yet.<br>Just so - called</p>
<p>A look at the document is as fierce as a tiger and a write code is as unintelligent as a dog.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the field of programmers, Impostor Syndrome is more serious psychologically.</p>
<p>In fact, everyone is doing the work of screwing screws. From interns to tech lead, it is said that they all feel similar.</p>
<p>It is really important to maintain a healthy state of mind.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there will be no tragedies for programmers</p>
<p>In the field of programmers, it is important to learn all one’s life as the technology is updated so quickly, but it is also important to know one’s strengths and give full play to them.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, it is not easy for programmers to enter the industry. What is taught and trained cannot be quickly translated into engineering.</p>
<p>In particular, large companies, technology debt I do not know if you have any feelings</p>
<p>If you want to get started in a big company, you can’t write a toy project without knowing where you are.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of lines of code, clue can’t touch, it is normal</p>

            <p>Seeing that programmers have little chance of interviewing without three years of experience?</p>
<p>What skills do you have that require more skill than the real job?</p>
<p>Even programmers who have been working for some years are embarrassed to be unable to answer questions in interviews?</p>
<p>More and more training institutions of all kinds?<br>Programmers at work need to study various new technologies or algorithms that are not commonly used at work after work, so that the underlying principles can remain competitive?</p>
<p>The recruitment was released and dozens or hundreds of resumes were received.</p>
<p>Does the above situation mean that the programmer is saturated and surplus?<br>If there is a surplus, what is the ratio of supply to demand?</p>
<p>Here is an answer:</p>
<p>Excess.<br>It is very simple to see whether an industry is surplus or not. You just need to see if your competitors are similar to you.</p>
<p>But whenever you find a large number of your competitors:</p>
<p>I am older than you, have higher education background, better technology, more experience, and require the same salary as you.</p>
<p>That is iron surplus.</p>
<p>Don’t listen to those who say that there is no surplus at the high end and surplus at the low end. Of course, the high end is scarce everywhere.</p>
<p>But as a human being, don’t think you are superior to others.</p>

            <p>Programmers are essentially different from workers in textile factories, shoe factories and steel factories who burn boilers.<br>Attention is paid to the essential difference in working methods, not to say that there are differences in class status as workers. In class status, there is no essential difference in the type of work as a programmer between workers in textile factories, shoe factories and steel factories who burn boilers.<br>The biggest difference between programmers and other types of labor is that programmers’ labor cannot be simply duplicated, while the labor of textile factory workers and shoe factory workers is basically simply duplicated, producing the same products day after day with the same technology and little difference in appearance.<br>Programmers are closer to jobs that cannot be simply copied by early blacksmiths, modern doctors, lawyers, etc., but programmers work directly in the abstract layer instead of the physical layer and do not need physical copying.<br>Ford invented assembly line production, which breaks down the process of manufacturing a car and trains workers into simple and duplicated labor force specialized in manually completing the process, thus improving labor productivity.  However, in the software development industry, enterprises that want to refer to Ford’s assembly line approach have all failed, and none of them have succeeded, because computers can complete tasks that can be simply copied without manual copying.  Even in modern automobile manufacturing, simple processes are completed by robots, and workers are no longer required to repeat simple labor manually.<br>Programmers are one step closer than craftsmen, doctors and lawyers. Therefore, I said that the type of work of programmers has undergone qualitative changes and is essentially different from other types of work.  This qualitative change is that programmers will eliminate the work of programmers who once existed.  For example, early programmers did not have a good debugger, and it was very important for them to understand stacks. Then programmers built advanced debuggers for themselves. Now programmers do not need to understand stacks of binary data at all.  This kind of phenomenon has also happened to artisans, but artisans still need to repeatedly create their own tools to facilitate their own, but programmers do not need to. After a tool is invented, it can be shared by all programmers without the traditional “duplication” of labor costs. The speed of self-innovation is unprecedented in any traditional labor.<br>This rapid self-innovation has led programmers to be more like researchers and engineers than workers who provide simple repetitive work. Any simple skills already mastered quickly become outdated, and any project is like a brand-new research.  This qualitative change will have a great impact on the composition of the labor force, and more and more labor will work at the abstract level instead of making physical copies through simple labor-assisted machines.<br>This qualitative change will also lead to a change in the class status of the working class. In the past, the ruling class could control the operation of the society by controlling all kinds of physical resources through ownership. However, if the whole society works at the abstract level, the concept of ownership of the ruling class will fall apart. When ordinary physical objects are no longer important, more important ideas, algorithms and ideas are difficult to label as ownership and can be quickly shared.  The meaning of the traditional ruling class will be shaken.<br>In the future, everyone may be “programmers”, but probably not all of them need to write code.</p>

            <p>I feel that we are also very low-key, and do not flaunt that we have to be superior. They are all working. There are still some differences between ordinary workshop workers and us. The on-line and off-line skills of workshop workers and their responsibilities are sometimes not at the same level as programmers.<br>Some programmers lost billions of dollars due to downtime, investors lost hundreds of millions due to bugs in financial products, companies lost due to incorrect calculations in financial and reporting systems, and bugs due to transfer systems. These are all programmers’ pots. The exchange rate is not right. bug can also lead to economic losses in settlement. The above are all kinds of scenarios that programmers who maintain the system in your mouth can’t do well.<br>If you look at Ali’s disaster preparedness, can you endure that the money in your Alipay is somehow stolen? Can you tolerate your system being hacked to steal all your business information? Can you stand being sold all kinds of personal information and harassed by phone calls every day? Which of the above is not the pot of data leakage or the pot of product bug?<br>To put it bluntly, who do you want to manage this billion-dollar business without offering people a good price? Capital is for profit, not for fools. Investors must always be treated as fools. If nothing happens, we will blow a wave of wind and belittle our programmers. How can we programmers have the spare time to hack other professions? We haven’t worked honestly yet? How many gb and dozens of gb of source code do you see in your company?<br>If you look at a few mb of e-books, it’s too much content. You’re still hacking at our programmers. With such a complicated business, tens of megabytes of code are embedded in each other’s logic. Sometimes you make a mistake, and you’re likely to have a big disaster in your life, you know?<br>Textile workers are no different from us in terms of labor. We are all workers, all in the service industry, all working for capital. But can they bear the same responsibilities behind them? Can mistakes cost the same? Can you bear the same result?<br>Please don’t be a black programmer. Who doesn’t mix? Is it not good to let each other go? What is tuyere pig? Do you think fortune 996 is joking with you? Laughing all day and earning money? How come there are so many programmers who died suddenly without so much pressure? You’ve been a fool working overtime, you know? Now some people say that you are a pig of tuyere, aren’t you angry?<br>One day our programmers will collectively lose their jobs and will no longer be pigs in that wind tunnel. You can just look at the 1990s and still want to surf the Internet. Learn typing? Slash eggs at home, you!</p>

            <p>I am a junior college student, majoring in information management and information systems. I am not interested in learning management and want to do technology. now I am learning java by myself. I have taught myself some basics of java, such as multithreading, enumeration, paradigm and so on. recently I plan to learn MySQL and SQL Server and then learn some html and css, but I don’t know how far I can really go into the enterprise to learn and ask bosses to solve their doubts.</p>
<p>These friends around me have been Daniel in the Internet field for many years. Because of their life and personal habits, many of them do not have the habit of writing blogs or have not made them public. However, they met Shuai Bing. I am coquettish. I can help them sort it out.<br>The purpose is to let many newcomers like me have a clear understanding of a complete career planning path. What will bronze go through to become king?</p>
<p>Bronze-the Source of All Evil<br>“Computer Foundation”, this is the class all readers will take at the beginning of the university. I asked the kids in the group, and they all said yes. I think so too.<br>In the computer foundation, we will learn the history of the computer, the characteristics of the computer, the binary conversion, memory management, linear data structure, network request protocol and so on.<br>The computer foundation is really very important, extremely important, and extremely important. Why do I say that? There are many computer knowledge and network protocol knowledge involved in it, which will be used by everyone in the future. I can be responsible for telling you that the interview will certainly ask, what Http, Https, Tcp/Ip, three-way handshake, four wave interviews don’t ask too often.<br>Tip: There is an incident here. When Leader, the architect team next to me, interviewed Ali p8 this week, I thought that what source code and the research and operation of middleware were being asked. I think everyone thought the same as I did, but they were wrong and asked a lot of basic computer knowledge instead.<br>I chatted and asked about the interview content, what is the mirror image of binary tree, the understanding of kernel state and user state, the cache page of the computer, etc.<br>Are you surprised that he * is not the subject of our school?  Why do P8 bosses still ask this?  In fact, it is well understood that when you think about the length of service, the breadth and depth of the technology have certain attainments. You can’t optimize the code just like that. The machine configuration is also the best. What else can you optimize?<br>At the bottom, we all know that all languages become machine languages at the end of the day. At the end of the day, all languages have to interact with machines. Is the bottom of the computer the last thing to focus on?<br>Foley: He will come to our company for an interview this week. At that time, I will ask about the specific interview contents in detail. If you want to see, I can sort it out and write it down to see what the world of the strong at that level really is like.</p>
<p>After learning the basics of computers, you basically know a little about the whole knowledge system of computers. You may still be ignorant about programming, but you are now entering the door of programming.<br>Silver-Programming Lesson One<br>After the basic computer science, the introductory programming course will follow.<br>I think 99% of my friends in this article started their own program life with the following code:</p>
<p>I still remember Shuai Bing, the C language I studied at the beginning of my freshman year, and the textbook of “C Language Programming” written by Mr. Tan Haoqiang is the first chapter on page 27, HelloWord. Now I still remember it vividly. The teacher wrote down these two solemn words on the blackboard, and she and I at the same table showed infinite thirst for knowledge …<br>I think all languages begin with the basic grammar, and the basic grammar of programming languages is the same.<br>If, For, While and other keywords, List, Set, Map and other collections, Int, float, Double and other basic types, when you first learn, I don’t think you will know, these keywords will accompany us through their respective program career?<br>The next step is a bit more difficult, such as JDBC, IO, file flow and so on. Shuai Bing vaguely remembered writing SQL in the code at that time and then querying. I also don’t know if I remember correctly.<br>Learning from this, you may think that your JavaSE is invincible and you can find a job when you go out. Anyway, Shuai Bing at that time felt that he could make a big difference and showed off his skills everywhere.<br>But childish I don’t know, what is waiting for me in the unknown ahead, and I don’t know that I have just started, but if I want to develop in the direction of the WEB, these are basically enough.<br>But what you have learned so far is all server-side stuff. How can you show your server-side stuff to others?<br>At this time, we should make an ugly page for simple interaction. You should learn HTML, Servlet, MySQL, JavaScript, Tomcat, CSS, etc.<br>The goal is to write the first dynamic website, which may only be a login function and can only display personal data. However, this is a very important step. What you need to make clear is that where a user’s click Requests originate, receive, process and return, you need to understand the relationship and division of labor between the browser and the server, Cookie and Session, request and Response.<br>Tip: I remember I had a question just after I came out for an interview. What did an Http request go through from the start of the web page to the return of data generated by the server, or what did Spring do?  You can think about it<br>There is also a project of my own that is really very important. Aobing I did during my college years and has been running steadily on the campus internet so far. When I came out for the internship interview, I basically cut through all the obstacles and beat up the young fellow interviewers. Anyway, there is a project thief in the university who gets extra points. Do the readers’ college students remember it?<br>Gold-New Beginners<br>The above is only the initial stage of learning WEB development. These are the most primitive and official WEB development technologies since the birth of JAVA. Of course, these technologies are rarely directly used in real projects now. Now the front and back ends are separated. The language update iteration speed of Vue, Node.js, React and other front ends is very fast. Shuai Bing has just learned a little and is comfortable to use. Friends at the front end told me that they have iterated again … I * don’t learn!<br>In order to continuously improve the usability, development efficiency, maintainability and expandability of technologies, numerous open source projects are packaged and improved on the basis of these original technologies.<br>Therefore, at this stage, don’t blindly and optimistically go looking for a job or pick and choose about internships, you will be hit, or find a small company to muddle through. In the past few years, you felt disconnected from the new technology stack.<br>Some people tell you that small companies learn a lot, and they hurt you. At first, the bigger you can go, the better. You want to go to the big one, you want to go to the small one, but it is relatively difficult for you to go to the big one.<br>Well, the initial stage is completed and the topic of WEB development begins. First, the legendary framework. SSM(Spring SpringMVC Mybatis) is necessary to become a skilled programmer. At this stage, you also need to understand why these three are used instead of Jsp, Servlet and Jdbc. You need to realize the benefits of writing MVC and three-tier architecture.<br>At this stage, don’t easily question the value of the framework. Perhaps at first you will find it troublesome and think that they sometimes carry too many tasks. When I first wrote this, I found it really disgusting. What dao, service, Controller, etc. are there so many things to do?<br>After waiting for a year or two, you will find it difficult to work without these frameworks. Without a clear hierarchical system, you will start to lambaste the architect of the project.<br>You *</p>
<p>However, it is important to remind everyone that the mentality to be avoided at this stage is to be able to add, delete, modify and check skillfully, think that the procedure is just that, and then fill in the resume with proficiency, which is also one of the reasons why the novice interview was criticized to pieces.<br>It’s a big taboo for beginners to try and stop. Why do you write like this? What’s the advantage and disadvantage of writing like this? Ask a few more questions about why. You’ll thank Aobing after many years.<br>If you learn well, you should be able to write a blog, forum and other WEB projects skillfully, which is to meet the basic requirements of employment.<br>Tip: Besides, as a fresh graduate, besides basic knowledge, if you have your own technology blog and a decent project that can be shown to the interviewer, it is really a bonus. You know the project process and technology stack is familiar with it. You can also visit the website on your mobile phone to give the interviewer a live demonstration, which is a bonus.<br>My friends Java3y, JavaGuide, I don’t have three hearts, etc. I started to write my own blog at this stage, and each of them has made achievements. These are all part of your bargaining power in the interview, your bonus points and your own wealth.<br>I asked them, they have already got many interview invitations from big companies by blog. Anyway, if you have projects, good resumes and good blogs, you will be given extra points. If you have nothing, start to learn more now and play less two rounds of LOL. When you reach my age, you will find it boring.<br>Platinum-Zunyi Meeting<br>This will be a turning point in the programmer’s career. I have grasped the takeoff of life and lost everything, so I used the Zunyi meeting held in Zunyi, my hometown, as the title of this stage. I think it is wonderful!<br>Slowly, you will find that the performance of the database is really not good. out of unwilling status quo or following the fashion, it is time for you to learn about NoSQL. non-relational databases such as Memcached, Redis, Mongodb are dazzling. it doesn’t matter. try to use them, which can relieve the pressure of relational databases such as MySQL and Oracle.<br>For some business needs of the company, you may delve into a specific technical field, such as full-text search technology ElasticSearch (hereinafter referred to as Es). After you understand Es, how do you think about the synchronization of database data into Es?<br>You may come into contact with middleware such as Logstash and Canal, and then find that visualization is also a problem. Then Kibana came into being. When you use it, you will find that European participators are different from us. Then Ik Chinese participators need to understand again.<br>After using it, you will also find that Lucene at the bottom of it has many pits to avoid. You can also know Solr and so on with more time.<br>In a word, knowledge is a system. I often tell the young people in the group to form a knowledge system. You interviewed Es about the relevant technology stack, and you need to know the same thing. My title is “Hanging over the Interviewer”. If the interviewer is really deep in skills, I want to hang over 100% of you.<br>You will even begin to be interested in some special existence in the system, such as permission system, single sign-on and so on, or algorithm research in some specific business fields, which are your bonus items.<br>You also found that Http communication after service splitting has many disadvantages, and started to contact with excellent Rpc framework and message queue middleware, such as Dubbo, RocketMQ, etc.<br>Then you found out that the data volume was too large to hold the table. It took several seconds to find out hundreds of millions of data, and then the sub-database sub-table came out. What kind of horizontal split and vertical split did you learn from the sub-database sub-table middleware such as TDDL, Sharding-JDBC, DRDS, etc.<br>However, it is another problem for you to use the unique id to discover the global situation. Perhaps the middleware has its own, but you still need to understand the principle, what snowflake algorithm, uuid, etc. you also need to learn.<br>Then again, you find that the distribution of databases and tables is no longer sustainable, and the volume of business is increasing explosively. You may need to understand the solutions of dynamic distribution of databases and tables, especially some of FaceBook’s open source solutions.<br>Again and again later, you found that dynamic sub-database sub-table is also not good, a lot of offline data is also a lot of ah, every day a few t, the company will be lost, then you have to understand the big data scene offline analysis, data cache, data cleaning, data visualization and so on and so on.<br>What ODPS do you need to learn, Hadoop, Hive, Hbase and other middleware or tools?<br>Again and again, then you began to find your code is very messy. After a long time, you can’t understand it. Repeated, hard-to-reuse code is piling up, and you don’t want to maintain it. It is full of bugs.<br>Therefore, you should begin to attach importance to design patterns, reasonably reform your code habits, and no longer be bound by the rigid SSH and MVC three-tier architecture.<br>(Aobing, have you not played?  Ha ha, actually there is, I will not list it)</p>
<p>I don’t know if you have realized the meaning of the opening sentence of each article.  Aobing discovered that he was becoming more and more ignorant after working. Please taste the following sentence again.<br>The more you know, the more you don’t know</p>
<p>Google and various materials are the driving force for your progress. You rarely encounter problems that you have to ask others to solve. If you keep asking others at this stage, your technical career will be nearing the end.<br>At this stage, if you are as skilled as Ao Bing, your income will be white collar, at least close to, or significantly ahead of, your peers.<br>I think most programmers can reach this level after working for many years. Some people only need one or two years, while others need five or six years. Some people who are outdated at this stage are limited by their talent and thinking, some are lack of enthusiasm for technology, and some are restricted by their work content.<br>By the time he reached middle age, he could no longer compete with young people and was eliminated from the competition. He could only change his career in despair when he mocked himself as a diaosi and a code farmer.<br>This is a very important water distribution age. I think it depends on whether you can continue to make progress, whether you can continue to engage in technical work after the age of 30, and whether you can play a unique role in the company.<br>Many project managers who have worked for several years in rotten companies have not even reached this level.<br>For the 30-year-old himself, it is completely worthwhile to hear about layoffs. For the sake of the family’s old mother, she is no longer unwilling to turn on the light for the sake of saving electricity. For the sake of herself …<br>I think you should be prepared for this stage, which is why I introduce this stage in great length.<br>Masonry-Sailing Away</p>
<p>You have to read the source code of excellent open source projects. You have to understand some basic knowledge that you did not understand at that time. You begin to understand the essence of “thinking in java”. You can write some code at the bottom, and sometimes you feel that the package is better and simpler than some open source tools.<br>In-depth analysis of JVM virtual machine, which you did not understand at that time, now you can know the knowledge points inside very well, open your mouth and bring a large number of knowledge points into the project for optimization, and you can see substantial changes (implying KPI).<br>The difficulty and emphasis of the WEB always lies in the performance and load capacity. However, the development of the network has resulted in a large increase in data volume and operation density, while the hardware has not made corresponding progress.<br>You have to try to make better use of more servers to work together. from the WEB end to the server end to the database, all need clustering, distribution, reasonable control of the flow of data, good control of the balance between the website and a large number of machines, finding performance bottlenecks, finding stability and security bottlenecks, hardware failures, third-party technology errors, will be considered carefully as a common occurrence in your system and code.<br>You will begin to think that the scheme is extremely important. One will be incompetent and exhausted, and the other will be fulfilled. A bad design and a bad scheme will greatly reduce the work achievements of a group of excellent programmers.<br>You should pay attention to the knowledge of architecture and can no longer be satisfied with SSH’s three-tier architecture.<br>A series of ideas such as domain-driven design, event-oriented development, agile development, etc. can determine the life and death of your project at a critical moment. There is no standard paradigm for you to copy at this stage. You only know the ideas and principles, but practice requires you to continuously try and improve.<br>Pay more attention to all kinds of miscellaneous open source technologies, some of which you may have already touched before, related to communication, integrated development environment, and architecture. You should be able to casually mention several mainstream technologies in various fields, although you may only have heard and understood them.<br>But at the critical moment you have to know how to choose the technology and master it quickly.<br>You will also consider trying other languages. This is not to say turning to C++ C#. It has nothing to do with JAVA programmers. I am talking about some languages running on JVM, such as scala and groovy. When you first meet them, you will feel that Java is really old.<br>However, when you return to a comprehensive large-scale project, you will feel that the whole system technology accumulated by Java is so perfect, just like an industrial standard, you may find that you will benefit from the Spring family alone for life and cannot read it completely.<br>You can put this stage into practice and be competent for the project manager, even the technical director of small and medium-sized companies and the Leader of small team in large factories.<br>Master-reach the summit<br>In fact, when writing about the above stage, I feel that this is the place where many people are satisfied. They are all technical directors of small companies. What do I want?<br>But the unknown life is still waiting for you. I asked the top gods around me, why do you want to go out of the comfort zone?  What about places like bytes and Ali, where the pressure is much higher?<br>The answers they give are different, but the same is to challenge yourself. No one knows where is their destination. Then why not try more? The new environment, the new technology stack, the new business scene challenge the new self.<br>At this stage, your every move may be related to the life and death of a project. A wrong or correct decision may change the fate of the whole project. Water can carry a boat and overturn it. I think it is just right to use it here.<br>There are very few bosses at this level around me, but they are not without them. They are all the core figures in the company. They lead the team to rush at the critical moment of large-scale projects or projects. In addition to problems, they can also give solutions and solutions as soon as possible.<br>Tip: My current boss is such a person. When the 11th of the 11th of the 12th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the<br>This is the world of the strong, the world I yearn for. Of course, I know that only one step at a time can I set foot in this world.</p>
<p>King-Top of Mount Tai<br>In the end, I won’t write anything about the king. There are only a few people who can reach this field. Aobing has them around. But I think everyone can understand it by themselves. Generally speaking, people have reached a certain height in networking, communication and ability. I also can’t understand the things at this stage.<br>All I can think of is the poem of my ancestors: pointing the country and denouncing Fang Qiu.<br>Let’s say it leaves us room for endless reverie. Maybe you will be the king in your field in the future, right?<br>Summary<br>Unconsciously, I have written so much. The above is my personal view of the general development route to JAVA programmers, and it is not comprehensive at all. The actual personal growth route may vary greatly due to different work contents. Some people prefer bottom-level research, others prefer business requirement design, some have strong industry color, and besides technology, there is also a lot of knowledge that is important. There is no easy direction to do JAVA. However, a person who is interested in technology will still have enthusiasm for development and want to write good projects at this step.<br>Cheng Xuyuan, who only works for a living, can’t get there. This line of work has come. Everyone works 24 hours a day. Why is there a gap? I think you and I both know why. Let’s do something about it.</p>

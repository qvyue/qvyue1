        <p>I am a junior college student, majoring in information management and information systems. I am not interested in learning management and want to do technology. now I am learning java by myself. I have taught myself some basics of java, such as multithreading, enumeration, paradigm and so on. recently I plan to learn MySQL and SQL Server and then learn some html and css, but I don’t know how far I can really go into the enterprise to learn and ask bosses to solve their doubts.</p>
<p>These friends around me have been Daniel in the Internet field for many years. Because of their life and personal habits, many of them do not have the habit of writing blogs or have not made them public. However, they met Shuai Bing. I am coquettish. I can help them sort it out.<br>The purpose is to let many newcomers like me have a clear understanding of a complete career planning path. What will bronze go through to become king?</p>
<p>Bronze-the Source of All Evil<br>“Computer Foundation”, this is the class all readers will take at the beginning of the university. I asked the kids in the group, and they all said yes. I think so too.<br>In the computer foundation, we will learn the history of the computer, the characteristics of the computer, the binary conversion, memory management, linear data structure, network request protocol and so on.<br>The computer foundation is really very important, extremely important, and extremely important. Why do I say that? There are many computer knowledge and network protocol knowledge involved in it, which will be used by everyone in the future. I can be responsible for telling you that the interview will certainly ask, what Http, Https, Tcp/Ip, three-way handshake, four wave interviews don’t ask too often.<br>Tip: There is an incident here. When Leader, the architect team next to me, interviewed Ali p8 this week, I thought that what source code and the research and operation of middleware were being asked. I think everyone thought the same as I did, but they were wrong and asked a lot of basic computer knowledge instead.<br>I chatted and asked about the interview content, what is the mirror image of binary tree, the understanding of kernel state and user state, the cache page of the computer, etc.<br>Are you surprised that he * is not the subject of our school?  Why do P8 bosses still ask this?  In fact, it is well understood that when you think about the length of service, the breadth and depth of the technology have certain attainments. You can’t optimize the code just like that. The machine configuration is also the best. What else can you optimize?<br>At the bottom, we all know that all languages become machine languages at the end of the day. At the end of the day, all languages have to interact with machines. Is the bottom of the computer the last thing to focus on?<br>Foley: He will come to our company for an interview this week. At that time, I will ask about the specific interview contents in detail. If you want to see, I can sort it out and write it down to see what the world of the strong at that level really is like.</p>
<p>After learning the basics of computers, you basically know a little about the whole knowledge system of computers. You may still be ignorant about programming, but you are now entering the door of programming.<br>Silver-Programming Lesson One<br>After the basic computer science, the introductory programming course will follow.<br>I think 99% of my friends in this article started their own program life with the following code:</p>
<p>I still remember Shuai Bing, the C language I studied at the beginning of my freshman year, and the textbook of “C Language Programming” written by Mr. Tan Haoqiang is the first chapter on page 27, HelloWord. Now I still remember it vividly. The teacher wrote down these two solemn words on the blackboard, and she and I at the same table showed infinite thirst for knowledge …<br>I think all languages begin with the basic grammar, and the basic grammar of programming languages is the same.<br>If, For, While and other keywords, List, Set, Map and other collections, Int, float, Double and other basic types, when you first learn, I don’t think you will know, these keywords will accompany us through their respective program career?<br>The next step is a bit more difficult, such as JDBC, IO, file flow and so on. Shuai Bing vaguely remembered writing SQL in the code at that time and then querying. I also don’t know if I remember correctly.<br>Learning from this, you may think that your JavaSE is invincible and you can find a job when you go out. Anyway, Shuai Bing at that time felt that he could make a big difference and showed off his skills everywhere.<br>But childish I don’t know, what is waiting for me in the unknown ahead, and I don’t know that I have just started, but if I want to develop in the direction of the WEB, these are basically enough.<br>But what you have learned so far is all server-side stuff. How can you show your server-side stuff to others?<br>At this time, we should make an ugly page for simple interaction. You should learn HTML, Servlet, MySQL, JavaScript, Tomcat, CSS, etc.<br>The goal is to write the first dynamic website, which may only be a login function and can only display personal data. However, this is a very important step. What you need to make clear is that where a user’s click Requests originate, receive, process and return, you need to understand the relationship and division of labor between the browser and the server, Cookie and Session, request and Response.<br>Tip: I remember I had a question just after I came out for an interview. What did an Http request go through from the start of the web page to the return of data generated by the server, or what did Spring do?  You can think about it<br>There is also a project of my own that is really very important. Aobing I did during my college years and has been running steadily on the campus internet so far. When I came out for the internship interview, I basically cut through all the obstacles and beat up the young fellow interviewers. Anyway, there is a project thief in the university who gets extra points. Do the readers’ college students remember it?<br>Gold-New Beginners<br>The above is only the initial stage of learning WEB development. These are the most primitive and official WEB development technologies since the birth of JAVA. Of course, these technologies are rarely directly used in real projects now. Now the front and back ends are separated. The language update iteration speed of Vue, Node.js, React and other front ends is very fast. Shuai Bing has just learned a little and is comfortable to use. Friends at the front end told me that they have iterated again … I * don’t learn!<br>In order to continuously improve the usability, development efficiency, maintainability and expandability of technologies, numerous open source projects are packaged and improved on the basis of these original technologies.<br>Therefore, at this stage, don’t blindly and optimistically go looking for a job or pick and choose about internships, you will be hit, or find a small company to muddle through. In the past few years, you felt disconnected from the new technology stack.<br>Some people tell you that small companies learn a lot, and they hurt you. At first, the bigger you can go, the better. You want to go to the big one, you want to go to the small one, but it is relatively difficult for you to go to the big one.<br>Well, the initial stage is completed and the topic of WEB development begins. First, the legendary framework. SSM(Spring SpringMVC Mybatis) is necessary to become a skilled programmer. At this stage, you also need to understand why these three are used instead of Jsp, Servlet and Jdbc. You need to realize the benefits of writing MVC and three-tier architecture.<br>At this stage, don’t easily question the value of the framework. Perhaps at first you will find it troublesome and think that they sometimes carry too many tasks. When I first wrote this, I found it really disgusting. What dao, service, Controller, etc. are there so many things to do?<br>After waiting for a year or two, you will find it difficult to work without these frameworks. Without a clear hierarchical system, you will start to lambaste the architect of the project.<br>You *</p>
<p>However, it is important to remind everyone that the mentality to be avoided at this stage is to be able to add, delete, modify and check skillfully, think that the procedure is just that, and then fill in the resume with proficiency, which is also one of the reasons why the novice interview was criticized to pieces.<br>It’s a big taboo for beginners to try and stop. Why do you write like this? What’s the advantage and disadvantage of writing like this? Ask a few more questions about why. You’ll thank Aobing after many years.<br>If you learn well, you should be able to write a blog, forum and other WEB projects skillfully, which is to meet the basic requirements of employment.<br>Tip: Besides, as a fresh graduate, besides basic knowledge, if you have your own technology blog and a decent project that can be shown to the interviewer, it is really a bonus. You know the project process and technology stack is familiar with it. You can also visit the website on your mobile phone to give the interviewer a live demonstration, which is a bonus.<br>My friends Java3y, JavaGuide, I don’t have three hearts, etc. I started to write my own blog at this stage, and each of them has made achievements. These are all part of your bargaining power in the interview, your bonus points and your own wealth.<br>I asked them, they have already got many interview invitations from big companies by blog. Anyway, if you have projects, good resumes and good blogs, you will be given extra points. If you have nothing, start to learn more now and play less two rounds of LOL. When you reach my age, you will find it boring.<br>Platinum-Zunyi Meeting<br>This will be a turning point in the programmer’s career. I have grasped the takeoff of life and lost everything, so I used the Zunyi meeting held in Zunyi, my hometown, as the title of this stage. I think it is wonderful!<br>Slowly, you will find that the performance of the database is really not good. out of unwilling status quo or following the fashion, it is time for you to learn about NoSQL. non-relational databases such as Memcached, Redis, Mongodb are dazzling. it doesn’t matter. try to use them, which can relieve the pressure of relational databases such as MySQL and Oracle.<br>For some business needs of the company, you may delve into a specific technical field, such as full-text search technology ElasticSearch (hereinafter referred to as Es). After you understand Es, how do you think about the synchronization of database data into Es?<br>You may come into contact with middleware such as Logstash and Canal, and then find that visualization is also a problem. Then Kibana came into being. When you use it, you will find that European participators are different from us. Then Ik Chinese participators need to understand again.<br>After using it, you will also find that Lucene at the bottom of it has many pits to avoid. You can also know Solr and so on with more time.<br>In a word, knowledge is a system. I often tell the young people in the group to form a knowledge system. You interviewed Es about the relevant technology stack, and you need to know the same thing. My title is “Hanging over the Interviewer”. If the interviewer is really deep in skills, I want to hang over 100% of you.<br>You will even begin to be interested in some special existence in the system, such as permission system, single sign-on and so on, or algorithm research in some specific business fields, which are your bonus items.<br>You also found that Http communication after service splitting has many disadvantages, and started to contact with excellent Rpc framework and message queue middleware, such as Dubbo, RocketMQ, etc.<br>Then you found out that the data volume was too large to hold the table. It took several seconds to find out hundreds of millions of data, and then the sub-database sub-table came out. What kind of horizontal split and vertical split did you learn from the sub-database sub-table middleware such as TDDL, Sharding-JDBC, DRDS, etc.<br>However, it is another problem for you to use the unique id to discover the global situation. Perhaps the middleware has its own, but you still need to understand the principle, what snowflake algorithm, uuid, etc. you also need to learn.<br>Then again, you find that the distribution of databases and tables is no longer sustainable, and the volume of business is increasing explosively. You may need to understand the solutions of dynamic distribution of databases and tables, especially some of FaceBook’s open source solutions.<br>Again and again later, you found that dynamic sub-database sub-table is also not good, a lot of offline data is also a lot of ah, every day a few t, the company will be lost, then you have to understand the big data scene offline analysis, data cache, data cleaning, data visualization and so on and so on.<br>What ODPS do you need to learn, Hadoop, Hive, Hbase and other middleware or tools?<br>Again and again, then you began to find your code is very messy. After a long time, you can’t understand it. Repeated, hard-to-reuse code is piling up, and you don’t want to maintain it. It is full of bugs.<br>Therefore, you should begin to attach importance to design patterns, reasonably reform your code habits, and no longer be bound by the rigid SSH and MVC three-tier architecture.<br>(Aobing, have you not played?  Ha ha, actually there is, I will not list it)</p>
<p>I don’t know if you have realized the meaning of the opening sentence of each article.  Aobing discovered that he was becoming more and more ignorant after working. Please taste the following sentence again.<br>The more you know, the more you don’t know</p>
<p>Google and various materials are the driving force for your progress. You rarely encounter problems that you have to ask others to solve. If you keep asking others at this stage, your technical career will be nearing the end.<br>At this stage, if you are as skilled as Ao Bing, your income will be white collar, at least close to, or significantly ahead of, your peers.<br>I think most programmers can reach this level after working for many years. Some people only need one or two years, while others need five or six years. Some people who are outdated at this stage are limited by their talent and thinking, some are lack of enthusiasm for technology, and some are restricted by their work content.<br>By the time he reached middle age, he could no longer compete with young people and was eliminated from the competition. He could only change his career in despair when he mocked himself as a diaosi and a code farmer.<br>This is a very important water distribution age. I think it depends on whether you can continue to make progress, whether you can continue to engage in technical work after the age of 30, and whether you can play a unique role in the company.<br>Many project managers who have worked for several years in rotten companies have not even reached this level.<br>For the 30-year-old himself, it is completely worthwhile to hear about layoffs. For the sake of the family’s old mother, she is no longer unwilling to turn on the light for the sake of saving electricity. For the sake of herself …<br>I think you should be prepared for this stage, which is why I introduce this stage in great length.<br>Masonry-Sailing Away</p>
<p>You have to read the source code of excellent open source projects. You have to understand some basic knowledge that you did not understand at that time. You begin to understand the essence of “thinking in java”. You can write some code at the bottom, and sometimes you feel that the package is better and simpler than some open source tools.<br>In-depth analysis of JVM virtual machine, which you did not understand at that time, now you can know the knowledge points inside very well, open your mouth and bring a large number of knowledge points into the project for optimization, and you can see substantial changes (implying KPI).<br>The difficulty and emphasis of the WEB always lies in the performance and load capacity. However, the development of the network has resulted in a large increase in data volume and operation density, while the hardware has not made corresponding progress.<br>You have to try to make better use of more servers to work together. from the WEB end to the server end to the database, all need clustering, distribution, reasonable control of the flow of data, good control of the balance between the website and a large number of machines, finding performance bottlenecks, finding stability and security bottlenecks, hardware failures, third-party technology errors, will be considered carefully as a common occurrence in your system and code.<br>You will begin to think that the scheme is extremely important. One will be incompetent and exhausted, and the other will be fulfilled. A bad design and a bad scheme will greatly reduce the work achievements of a group of excellent programmers.<br>You should pay attention to the knowledge of architecture and can no longer be satisfied with SSH’s three-tier architecture.<br>A series of ideas such as domain-driven design, event-oriented development, agile development, etc. can determine the life and death of your project at a critical moment. There is no standard paradigm for you to copy at this stage. You only know the ideas and principles, but practice requires you to continuously try and improve.<br>Pay more attention to all kinds of miscellaneous open source technologies, some of which you may have already touched before, related to communication, integrated development environment, and architecture. You should be able to casually mention several mainstream technologies in various fields, although you may only have heard and understood them.<br>But at the critical moment you have to know how to choose the technology and master it quickly.<br>You will also consider trying other languages. This is not to say turning to C++ C#. It has nothing to do with JAVA programmers. I am talking about some languages running on JVM, such as scala and groovy. When you first meet them, you will feel that Java is really old.<br>However, when you return to a comprehensive large-scale project, you will feel that the whole system technology accumulated by Java is so perfect, just like an industrial standard, you may find that you will benefit from the Spring family alone for life and cannot read it completely.<br>You can put this stage into practice and be competent for the project manager, even the technical director of small and medium-sized companies and the Leader of small team in large factories.<br>Master-reach the summit<br>In fact, when writing about the above stage, I feel that this is the place where many people are satisfied. They are all technical directors of small companies. What do I want?<br>But the unknown life is still waiting for you. I asked the top gods around me, why do you want to go out of the comfort zone?  What about places like bytes and Ali, where the pressure is much higher?<br>The answers they give are different, but the same is to challenge yourself. No one knows where is their destination. Then why not try more? The new environment, the new technology stack, the new business scene challenge the new self.<br>At this stage, your every move may be related to the life and death of a project. A wrong or correct decision may change the fate of the whole project. Water can carry a boat and overturn it. I think it is just right to use it here.<br>There are very few bosses at this level around me, but they are not without them. They are all the core figures in the company. They lead the team to rush at the critical moment of large-scale projects or projects. In addition to problems, they can also give solutions and solutions as soon as possible.<br>Tip: My current boss is such a person. When the 11th of the 11th of the 12th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the 11th of the<br>This is the world of the strong, the world I yearn for. Of course, I know that only one step at a time can I set foot in this world.</p>
<p>King-Top of Mount Tai<br>In the end, I won’t write anything about the king. There are only a few people who can reach this field. Aobing has them around. But I think everyone can understand it by themselves. Generally speaking, people have reached a certain height in networking, communication and ability. I also can’t understand the things at this stage.<br>All I can think of is the poem of my ancestors: pointing the country and denouncing Fang Qiu.<br>Let’s say it leaves us room for endless reverie. Maybe you will be the king in your field in the future, right?<br>Summary<br>Unconsciously, I have written so much. The above is my personal view of the general development route to JAVA programmers, and it is not comprehensive at all. The actual personal growth route may vary greatly due to different work contents. Some people prefer bottom-level research, others prefer business requirement design, some have strong industry color, and besides technology, there is also a lot of knowledge that is important. There is no easy direction to do JAVA. However, a person who is interested in technology will still have enthusiasm for development and want to write good projects at this step.<br>Cheng Xuyuan, who only works for a living, can’t get there. This line of work has come. Everyone works 24 hours a day. Why is there a gap? I think you and I both know why. Let’s do something about it.</p>
